# aSyn_spread

Code to reproduce network analyses and pathology progression plots in Vatsa, Brynildsen, Goralski, Kurgat et al. "Network analysis of Î±-synuclein pathology progression reveals p21-activated kinases as regulators of vulnerability". 

## Requirements:
  - Tested with R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)
    - Requisite packages are listed in code/packages.R

## Tutorial

For a general overview of linear diffusion modeling in neurodegenerative disease, see tutorial in `example` folder here: https://github.com/ejcorn/tau-spread.

## Input specification

The file `aSyn_pipeline.R` is located in the main directory. This file will coordinate the sequential execution of all scripts within the code/ folder, generating all the figures in the paper and more. Custom specification of the following inputs at the top of `aSyn_pipeline.R` is required:
  - `basedir`:  path to the main directory containing the `code` and `data` folders 
  - `injection.site`: vector of character names of brain regions to inject pathology into
  - `measures`: character vector containing the names of the datasets being anayzed. For our dataset, these were measures of total, cell body, and neurite pathology.
  - `opdir`: here you can add some extra custom label for your output folder given a particular configuration at the top of the script
